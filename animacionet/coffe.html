    <h1>Making Coffe</h1> 

   <h2>Brewing</h2> 


    <p>>Coffee was introduced in France in 1657, and in Austria and Poland after the 1683 Battle of Vienna, when coffee was captured from supplies of the defeated Turks. When coffee reached North America during the Colonial period, it was initially not as successful as it had been in Europe as alcoholic beverages remained more popular.Clinical research indicates that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial as a stimulant in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption reduces the risk of some diseases, although some of the long-term studies are of questionable credibility.[5
    The earliest credible evidence of the drinking of coffee in the form of the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen from the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines, where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to current methods.[2] The Yemenis procured the coffee beans from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries and began cultivation. By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to Europe.</p>
    
    <p>The two most commonly grown coffee bean types are C. arabica and C. robusta. Coffee plants are cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Africa. As of 2018, Brazil was the leading grower of coffee beans, producing 35% of the world total.[6] Coffee is a major export commodity as the leading legal agricultural export for numerous countries.[7] It is one of the most valuable commodities exported by developing countries. Green, unroasted coffee is the most traded agricultural commodity and one of the most traded commodities overall, second only to petroleum.[8] Despite the sales of coffee reaching billions of dollars, those actually producing the beans are disproportionately living in poverty.[9] Critics also point to the coffee industry's negative impact on the environment and the clearing of land for coffee-growing and water use. The environmental costs and wage disparity of farmers are causing the market for fair trade and organic coffee to expand.[10]</p>

<h3 id="stepping">Stepping</h3>

<p>Steeping is a process of creating coffee by adding ground coffee to hot water.  It is one way to experience immersion brewing.
Steeped coffee offers complexity in flavors as the coffee grounds remain in the hot water for more extended periods compared to the other coffee preparation methods. For a cup of hot coffee, just under five minutes us appropriate for steeping. It is also possible to create a cold brew while steeping coffee. However, to accomplish this you will need to leave the coffee grounds in the water for around 24 hours.</p>

<p>For the best results, coarsely ground coffee should be used. Coarsely ground coffee is preferred to avoid having a cup of coffee that hs coffee dust suspended within the liquid. This could lead to coffee dust settling at the bottom of the cup

<h3 id="flitration">FILTRATION METHODS</h3>

   <p>The following remarks on the filtration of water are an abstract of a paper read by Granbery Jackson, C. E., before the Engineering Association of the South. After some prefatory remarks the writer pointed out that filtration and purification of water may be accomplished in the following ways: (1) The English filter-bed, or slow-sand filtering; (2) the American or mechanical system; (3) using some form of iron as the active agent; (4) galleries built along the banks of streams or by filter-cribs sunk in the stream itself; (5) aeration; (6) electrical process; (7) by household filters; (8) household filtration; (9) distillation— which, however, is hardly filtration. The first two systems are those most commonly employed, and the first is that in use in Philadelphia and some other large cities today. In many cases, where the water holds a large amount of solid matter in suspension, preliminary sedimentation, with or without a coagulant, is absolutely necessary, in order to avoid the early, clogging up of the sandbed and consequent reduction in working capacity, while at the same time increasing the cost of cleaning. This sedimentation process, however, need not always be accompanied by., the use of coagulants, or these may be called for only under peculiar conditions, temporary, perhaps, or recurring at certain periods of the year. Sometimes (as in the case of the water of one of the late water companies of London, England), fifteen days may be required for the process of sedimentation. In the case of new sand filterbeds, and, to a certain extent, after cleaning them, it takes some time before the efficiency of the filters is. established, as the slimy and gelatinous coating (schmutzdecke), whose place is supplied by the coagulant used in mechanical filtration, which accumulates on the upper surface and is due to the growth of bacteria and the exudation from them, is not formed all at once. This sediment layer, which is usually from one-half to one degree in thickness, has to be removed, after draining the bed, by scraping, the sand being subsequently washed and used over again. After successive scrapings, when the upper layer of fine sand has been reduced to about twelve degrees, it is restored to its orginal depth—some fifty per cent, of the four to eight feet of stratified filtering material, consisting of coarse gravel or broken stone at the bottom, with fine sand on top. Of course, such filters call for the use of a large quantity of land, as sedimentatin basins, filterbeds and a pure water reservoir are necessary. The last must be large enough’ to equalise the supply—from two to three hours’ average consumption, besides a sufficient fire reserve. As to the latter, experts estimate the number of fire streams required simultaneously in a city of 150,000 people at twentyfive, equivalent to 375,000 gallons per hour. Assuming 150 gallons per capita and ten hours’ continuous service from twenty-five streams, there would be required a pure-watcr reservoir of about 6,000,000 gallons—4,000,000 for 100,000 population. The mechanical filters are of the gravity and pressure types—the water in the latter being forced more rapidly through the filtering medium. In each some form of coagulant is called for, and sometimes sedimentation, also. The rate of filtration, instead of being from 3,000,000 to 4,000,ooo gallons per acre, is usually about 125,000,000— a rapidity of rate which calls for more frequent cleaning of the sandbed, which is done by thoroughly washing it with filtered Water. To effect this it is necessary, first, to draw the sandbed, close the drain discharge-valves and open other valves, which admit a large volume of water under considerable pressure into the drainage system, from which it flows upwards through the sandbed, which is broken up by a series of revolving rakes, operated by steam, or by forcing compressed air upwards through the strainer system. A few minutes’ washing of the sandbed each day with about five per cent, of the water filtered is usually sufficient to keep the bed clean. A filtration tank of sixteen feet in diameter is sufficient to filter 500,000 gallons daily. The coagulant commonly used is sulphate of alumina, and the amount employed depends altogether upon the kind of water treated.</p>

Pressure (symbol: p or P) is the force applied perpendicular to the surface of an object per unit area over which that force is distributed.[1]: 445  Gauge pressure (also spelled gage pressure)[a] is the pressure relative to the ambient pressure.</p>

<p>Various units are used to express pressure. Some of these derive from a unit of force divided by a unit of area; the SI unit of pressure, the pascal (Pa), for example, is one newton per square metre (N/m2); similarly, the pound-force per square inch (psi) is the traditional unit of pressure in the imperial and U.S. customary systems. Pressure may also be expressed in terms of standard atmospheric pressure; the atmosphere (atm) is equal to this pressure, and the torr is defined as 1⁄760 of this. Manometric units such as the centimetre of water, millimetre of mercury, and inch of mercury are used to express pressures in terms of the height of column of a particular fluid in a manometer.</p>
